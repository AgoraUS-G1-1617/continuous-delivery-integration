# Continuous Delivery Playground
My playground for setting up a continuous delivery pipeline.

- Jenkins (started in a Docker container)
- GitLab (stared in a Docker container)
- Using a simple Dropwizard microservice as an example application
- Using a Docker image (containing the microservice) to create reproducible environments for all stages of the continuous delivery pipeline.

# Getting started
````bash
./startGitLab.sh
# wait for startup
# create project 'hello-world-app' in GitLab
./createHelloWorldAppAndConnectToGitLab.sh
# to be continued...
````
